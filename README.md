# Mastermind---The-guessing-game
A guessing game written in python

CPU will randomly generate a 4 digit number. You have to guess the number within 8 tries.

Once you have given an entry you will get an output array which indicates how close you are to the actual number.
1 - The number is present and it is in the right place
0 - The number is present but not in the right place
. - The number is not present

Have fun! :)
